Professional Experience
Senior Software Developer / AI Engineer
Mandrill Tech Sdn Bhd — Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (Hybrid)
Nov 2020 – Present
Leading AI and software engineering initiatives focused on financial technology, biometrics, and
document intelligence. Responsible for designing intelligent systems, automating business
workflows, and deploying ML pipelines in production environments.
Key Contributions:
• Financial Advisor Chatbot
◦ Involved in creating the metadata filter for vector search. Created metadata extractor
that extract metadata to be used in metadata filtering during the vector search. The
product search from the vector database improved by 15%
◦ Involved in LLMs and semantic similarity models to automate financial transaction
tagging.
◦ Upserting, Vectorizing the financial product data description into VectorDB.
◦ Involved in migrating the VectorDB from PGvector to Pinecone.
◦ Automate the schema migration for the the chat database.
◦ Involved in deployment into SIT, UAT environment.
• Bank Transaction Classification
◦ Applied LLMs which is BERT and comparing the performance with traditional RNN
model which is LSTM to automate financial transaction tagging. Result showed
BERT model outperforms LSTM just by 2%
◦ Improved categorization accuracy by over 30% and enhanced downstream expense
insights for users.
• Financial Product Recommendation System
◦ Designed hybrid rule-based and score-based recommendation engines for:
▪ Credit card selection (cashback, points).
▪ Refinancing eligibility based on DSR.
▪ Insurance products based on age and financial risk profiles.
◦ Helped improve financial literacy and user conversion rates for clients.
• Financial Mathematical Framework (FMF) API
◦ Developed a financial analytics engine that computes user-level financial health
metrics over time.
◦ Exposed via FastAPI and integrated with banking dashboards.
• NER Pipeline for Textual Financial Data
◦ Generated, labeled, and trained NER models to extract entities such as bank names,
loan types, and monetary values from user chats and scanned documents.
• eKYC System Development
◦ Built a complete KYC verification pipeline using:
▪ Document segmentation.
▪ Landmark Detection
▪ Liveliness detection
▪ Face detection and facial matching with landmark analysis.
▪ Blur/glare detection for document quality checks.
▪ OCR for national ID/passport verification (MRZ parsing).
◦ Integrated with client onboarding platforms and passed accuracy benchmarks.
• Mobile OCR App PoC
◦ Built an Android proof-of-concept to scan and read utility meter readings offline
using embedded TensorFlow Lite OCR models.
• Traffic Violation Detection System
◦ Developed deep learning models for red-light detection, vehicle tracking, and license
plate OCR from CCTV feeds.
◦ Reduced false positives using image quality heuristics and temporal consistency.
• Annotation Tooling and Workflow Automation
◦ Created Python scripts for semi-automated annotation using weak supervision,
boosting dataset creation speed.
• GPU Environment Setup
◦ Deployed Dockerized GPU environments for model training.
◦ Reduced training time by 40% through optimization techniques (mixed precision,
data parallelism).
• Schema Migration Tooling
◦ Wrote database migration scripts to manage PostgreSQL schema changes for ML-
integrated applications.
